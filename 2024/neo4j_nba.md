Neo4j Code:
For the given player_team data, in Neo4j we represent data as nodes and relationships. The data you provided is a relationship between a player and a team for a given season. Thus, the PLAYER_NAME, PLAYER_ID, and SEASON would be attributes of the Player node, while TEAM_ID would be an attribute of the Team node.

Here is how you would represent and query the data in Neo4j based on the MongoDB operations you provided above:

Basic Operations:
Creating Nodes:
To create nodes for players and teams:

cypher
Copy code
CREATE (p:Player {PLAYER_NAME: "Royce O'Neale", PLAYER_ID: 1626220, SEASON: 2019}),
       (t:Team {TEAM_ID: 1610612762}),
       (p)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(t);
Displaying a Sample Node:
cypher
Copy code
MATCH (p:Player)
RETURN p
LIMIT 1;
Displaying a Few Nodes:
cypher
Copy code
MATCH (p:Player)
RETURN p
LIMIT 5;
Count of Nodes:
cypher
Copy code
MATCH (p:Player)
RETURN COUNT(p);
Query Operation:
Simple Queries:
cypher
Copy code
MATCH (p:Player {PLAYER_NAME: "Royce O'Neale"})
RETURN p;

MATCH (t:Team {TEAM_ID: 1610612762})
RETURN t;
Using WHERE for conditions:
cypher
Copy code
MATCH (p:Player)
WHERE p.SEASON = 2019
RETURN p;
Advanced Query Operations:
Aggregations:
To find out how many players are associated with each team:

cypher
Copy code
MATCH (p:Player)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(t:Team)
RETURN t.TEAM_ID, COUNT(p) AS player_count;
Data Manipulation Operations:
Updating a Node:
cypher
Copy code
MATCH (p:Player {PLAYER_NAME: "Royce O'Neale"})
SET p.PLAYER_NAME = "Royce Updated Name";
Deleting a Node:
Deleting a player:

cypher
Copy code
MATCH (p:Player {PLAYER_NAME: "Royce O'Neale"})
DETACH DELETE p;
The DETACH DELETE command ensures that any relationships associated with the player node are deleted as well.

Relationship:
Establishing a relationship between a player and a team:

cypher
Copy code
MATCH (p:Player {PLAYER_NAME: "Royce O'Neale"}), (t:Team {TEAM_ID: 1610612762})
CREATE (p)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(t);
Joins:
Since Neo4j is a graph database, joins are essentially traversing relationships:

cypher
Copy code
MATCH (p:Player)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(t:Team)
RETURN p, t;
This is a simple "join" operation where you find all players and the teams they belong to.

Other Useful Operations:
Index:
Creating an index on the PLAYER_NAME field for the Player label:

cypher
Copy code
CREATE INDEX ON :Player(PLAYER_NAME);
This will enhance the performance of search queries based on the PLAYER_NAME.

Full-text Search:
For full-text search, you'd typically use CONTAINS:

cypher
Copy code
MATCH (p:Player)
WHERE p.PLAYER_NAME CONTAINS "O'Neale"
RETURN p;
This is a basic introduction to translating your MongoDB operations to Neo4j. Note that while there's a lot of similarity in the types of operations you'd perform, the underlying data model (document-oriented vs. graph) and query paradigms are quite different between MongoDB and Neo4j.
